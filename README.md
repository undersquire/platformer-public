**NOTE:** This project is not a good example of "professional" code. I wrote this in 2 weeks for a school project, so don't expect the cleanest or most efficient code.

**NOTE 2:** The art is not mine, I got it from [OpenGameArt](https://www.opengameart.org/). I just combined it all into a single PNG for easier asset management ðŸ¤“
